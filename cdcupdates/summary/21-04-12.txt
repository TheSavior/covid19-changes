Interpretive Summary for April 9, 2021
Vigilance Matters When Viruses Vary
The United States is in the fourth week of an upward trend in COVID-19 cases. The lifting of social distancing and mask mandates in some areas could be contributing to this increase. This increase could also be due to the presence of more contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is why it is important to remain vigilant.
Viruses change constantly through mutation, so new variants are expected to occur as the virus spreads. Some variants pose a bigger threat than others. B.1.1.7 is the most common variant circulating in the United States and has been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Understanding variants and their spread will help us contain the virus.
CDC recently introduced a classification system to rank the risk of the variants that we are monitoring, similar to the way the weather service ranks hurricanes. The classification system characterizes emerging variants based on their characteristics and the resulting actions and consequences for public health. CDC’s three classification categories include Variants of Interest (VOI), Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of High Consequence (VOHC). CDC is currently monitoring five variants of concern in the United States; none of the variants circulating in the United States are classified as variants of high consequence. Many of the variants circulating in the United States do not fall into one of these categories, but CDC continues to monitor them.

The best way to slow the emergence of new variants is to slow the spread of COVID-19 by wearing a mask that covers your nose and mouth, staying 6 feet away from people who don’t live with you, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces, and getting a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to you.
Reported CasesSince March 20, 2021, the 7-day moving average of new cases has consistently remained higher compared with the previous 7-day moving average. The current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (64,152) increased 2.0% compared with the previous 7-day moving average. However, the 7-day average decreased 74.3% compared with the highest peak on January 8, 2021 (249,697), and 4.7% compared with the second highest peak on July 23, 2020 (67,348). A total of 30,737,477 COVID-19 cases were reported as of April 7, 2021, including 74,860 new cases.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsCDC recently updated the COVID Data Tracker to include the most recent proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants nationally and in states where there is enough data for CDC to monitor variants. The Variant Surveillance section of the COVID Data Tracker provides an overview of published sequencing data and a global variant report map by country.
To provide a better picture of how widespread specific variants are in the US, CDC analyzes available genomic sequence data from specimens of SARS-CoV-2 collected from patients. This data is weighted to account for known differences in diagnostic testing and sequencing across time and geography. Based on the currently available data from early March, an estimated 27.2% of COVID-19 cases in the United States are caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7. The proportion of cases caused by B.1.429 is estimated at 9.1% and the proportion of cases caused by B.1.427 is estimated at 4.3%. Variants P.1 and B.1.351 are both estimated to be 0.5% of the current COVID-19 cases.
CDC and partners are increasing the numbers of specimens sequenced in laboratories around the country. Studies are underway to determine whether variants are more transmissible, cause more severe illness, or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination.

TestingThe percentage of COVID-19 RT-PCR tests that are positive (percent positivity) has increased from the previous week. The 7-day average of percent positivity from tests is now 5.5%. The 7-day average test volume for March 26–April 1, 2021, was 1,172,235, down 2.2% from 1,198,428 for the prior 7 days.

VaccinationsThe US COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14. As of April 8, 2021, 174.9 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 112.0 million people, or 33.7% of the US population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 66.2 million people, or 19.9% of the US population, have been fully vaccinated.* As of April 8, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 3.0 million, a 4.5% increase from the previous week.
The COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of April 8, 76.9% of people 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine; 58.4% are fully vaccinated. More than one-third (43.2%) of people 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine; 25.6% are fully vaccinated.

Trends in Hospitalizations by Age GroupOlder adults are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including an increased risk for hospitalization. Since the start of the pandemic, adults aged 65 years and older were the age group with the highest rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. While rates of hospitalization have fallen for all age groups since the peak in early January 2021, the rates for these older adults have fallen the most. Rates of hospitalization in adults aged 65 years and older have decreased by more than 70% in the past two months, from 70.2 per 100,000 in early January to less than 20 per 100,000 in recent weeks. However, rates have plateaued or risen in recent weeks in all age groups.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.
