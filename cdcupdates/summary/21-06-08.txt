Interpretive Summary for June 4, 2021
Trending: Teens
resize iconView LargerClosedownload iconDownload Image[JPG]
A recent CDC study found COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among adolescents ages 12-17 years increased during March and April, following declines in January and February 2021. This trend differed from hospitalization rates among people ages 65 years and older—the age group with the highest COVID-19 vaccination coverage—who saw hospitalization rates stabilize during the same timeframe.
While rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization in adolescents are lower than those in adults, cases of severe disease (including those requiring ICU admission or mechanical ventilation) have been documented in this age group. Recent increases in COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates and the potential for severe disease in adolescents reinforce the importance of continued prevention strategies, including vaccination and the correct and consistent use of masks in those who are not yet fully vaccinated.
With summer upon us, many adolescents are looking forward to returning to activities they may have missed last summer, including travel, hanging out with friends, work, and summer camp. Vaccinating adolescents is an important step toward stopping the spread of COVID-19. As of June 3, 2021, more than 5.9 million adolescents ages 12-17 years have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Fully vaccinated adolescents are at low risk of symptomatic or severe infection and are less likely to transmit COVID-19 to others. If you or someone you know is considering adolescent vaccination, talk with your pediatrician or healthcare provider about the benefits of vaccination.

Note to Readers: This week, CDC celebrates the 70th anniversary of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, a unique training program of service and on-the-job learning. CDC’s EIS officers—better known as CDC’s elite “disease detectives”—have served on the front lines of public health, investigating threats in the United States and around the world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 120 EIS officers have deployed nearly 400 times to airport screening stations, quarantine stations, state and local health departments, and the CDC Emergency Operations Center to assist with the nation’s response to COVID-19.
Reported CasesThe current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (14,349) decreased 35.2% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (22,139). Compared with the highest peak on January 9, 2021 (251,374), the current 7-day average decreased 94.3%.  A total of 33,130,027 COVID-19 cases have been reported as of June 2.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsMultiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally and within the United States. To date, five variants have been classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Nowcast estimates* of SARS-CoV-2 cases caused by these VOCs for the two weeks ending May 22 are summarized here. Nationally, B.1.1.7 proportions are predicted to increase to 73%; P.1 proportions are predicted to increase to 9.8%. B.1.427/B.1.429 proportions are predicted to decrease; and B.1.351 proportions are predicted to stay the same. Nowcast estimates predict that B.1.1.7 proportions will remain at more than 60% in all but HHS regions 1, 2, and 10. B.1.351 is predicted to remain higher in regions 7, 9, and 10; P.1 is predicted to be more than 10% in regions 1 and 10; and B.1.427/429 will remain highest in regions 9 and 10. B.1.617.2, a variant of interest, is predicted to be higher in regions 6, 7, 8, and 9.
*Current Nowcast estimates are modeled data based on sequencing data from previous weeks. Nowcast provides timely estimates for the present, while accounting for limited sequence data availability, as specimens from the most current time interval are still being processed.

TestingThe percentage of COVID-19 NAATs (nucleic acid amplification tests) that are positive (percent positivity) has decreased from the previous week. The 7-day average of percent positivity from tests is now 2.2%. The 7-day average number of tests reported for May 21-May 27 was 814,444, down 11.2% from 916,804 for the prior 7 days.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14, 2020. As of June 3, 297.7 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 169.1 million people, or 50.9% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 136.6 million people, or 41.2% of the total U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated. As of June 3, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 1.0 million, a 38.2% decrease from the previous week.
The COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of June 3, 86% of people ages 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 75% are fully vaccinated. Over half (63%) of people ages 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 52% are fully vaccinated.

New admissions are pulled from a 10 am EST snapshot of the HHS Unified Hospital Timeseries Dataset. Due to potential reporting delays, data from the most recent 7 days, as noted in the figure above with the grey bar, should be interpreted with caution. Small shifts in historic data may also occur due to changes in the CMS Provider of Services file, which is used to identify the cohort of included hospitals.

COVID-NET: Rate of COVID-19-Associated Hospitalizations in Adolescents Ages 12–17 Years
CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) now has data describing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents ages 12–17 years. While rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization in adolescents ages 12–17 years are lower than those in adults, cases of severe disease have been documented in this younger age group. Weekly adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and then rose again through April and early May to a peak of 1.5 per 100,000.
Additional information on COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents ages 12–17 years can be found in a new report using COVID-NET data here.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.
