Interpretive Summary for April 2, 2021
The Race to Vaccinate
The United States recently administered a record 3.38 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in a single day. As of April 1, 2021, nearly 154 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the United States, with over 56 million people having been fully vaccinated. We now have three historic, safe, and effective vaccines being administered across the country at a rapid pace, and more vaccines are in the works. A new CDC study shows that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and serious COVID-19 illness. Once fully vaccinated, a person’s risk of infection is reduced by up to 90%.
However, we are also seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases, including cases from new and emerging COVID-19 variants of concern. These variants of concern are mutated versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have the potential to cause COVID-19 to be more severe, spread more easily between humans, require different treatments, or change the effectiveness of current vaccines.
Scientists continue to learn how the vaccines protect people from variants. Until most of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, consistent use of public health prevention strategies, such as universal and correct use of masks, social distancing, hand washing, and vaccination, will help to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Even if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking these everyday precautions in public places.
The race to vaccinate people and contain the virus is underway. The actions we take today determine how long it will take to stop the virus and end the pandemic.
Reported CasesCOVID-19 cases were steadily decreasing for approximately 10 weeks; however, trends are changing, and cases have increased during the past 12 days. The current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (62,167) increased 8.4% compared with the previous 7 days. Compared with previous peaks, however, the 7-day average decreased 75.2% compared with the highest peak on January 11, 2021 (250,446), and 7.7% compared with the second highest peak on July 23, 2020 (67,337).

More Case Data
SARS-CoV-2 VariantsCDC recently updated the Variant Proportions in the U.S. web page to include the most recent proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants nationally and in states where there is enough data for CDC to monitor variants. Also, a new Variant Surveillance Section of the COVID Data Tracker was recently published with sequencing data and the global variant report map by country.
As of April 1, 2021, 12,505 B.1.1.7 variant cases have been reported in 51 jurisdictions. The United States has detected a total of 323 cases attributed to B.1.351 in 31 jurisdictions and 224 cases attributed to P.1 in 22 jurisdictions. In addition, we are closely monitoring the B.1.427 and B.1.429 variants that were first identified in the United States in January 2021. CDC and partners are increasing the numbers of specimens sequenced in laboratories around the country. Studies are underway to determine whether variants are more transmissible, cause more severe illness, or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination.

TestingThe percentage of COVID-19 RT-PCR tests that are positive (percent positivity) has increased slightly from the previous week. The 7-day average of percent positivity from tests is now 5.1%. The 7-day average test volume for March 19-March 25, 2021, was 1,162,774, down 1.5% from 1,180,332 for the prior 7 days.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14. As of April 1, 2021, 153.6 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 99.6 million people, or 30% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 56.1 million people, or 16.9% of the U.S. population have been fully vaccinated.* As of April 1, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 2.9 million, a 15.7% increase from the previous week.
The new COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of April 1, 73.7% of people 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine; 52% are fully vaccinated. More than one-third (38.4%) of people 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine; 21.7% are fully vaccinated.

Trends in Hospitalizations among Racial and Ethnic Minority GroupsLong-standing systemic health and social inequities have increased the risk for severe COVID-19 illnesses and death for many people in racial and ethnic minority groups. By improving race and ethnicity data collection and reporting, we continue to increase our understanding of health disparities related to COVID-19. This knowledge helps us create more equitable public health policies and prevention strategies.
COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates have decreased in all races and ethnicities after peaking in early January. Rates for American Indian and Alaska Native persons have dropped from a peak of 47.4 per 100,000 in November to less than 10 per 100,000 in recent weeks. Declines of more than 50% have been seen for other race and ethnicity groups. In addition, hospitalizations have decreased from their highest point in early January 2021.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.

DeathsExcept for an increase during March 27-28, 2021, overall, deaths have decreased for the past 11 weeks. On March 31, the 7-day average of daily new deaths decreased 7.7% compared with the prior 7 days (although the absolute number of deaths increased compared to the previous day). Compared with prior peaks, the current 7-day moving average of 880 daily new deaths decreased 74.0% compared with the highest peak on January 13, 2021 (3,379 deaths), and 23.3% compared with the peak on August 1, 2020 (1,148 deaths). As of March 31, 2021, a total of 549,098 COVID-19 deaths have been reported.
