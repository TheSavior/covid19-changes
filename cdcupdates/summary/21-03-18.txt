Interpretive Summary for March 12, 2021
The Unequal Toll of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to deepen health disparities in our country. Long-standing inequalities have increased the risk for severe COVID-19 illnesses and death for many people. This both causes and continues disparities between racial and ethnic minority groups and non-Hispanic white people. Unequal health risks are the result of different conditions where people live, work, learn, play, and age—what we call social determinants of health.
By improving race and ethnicity data collection and reporting, we continue to increase our understanding of health disparities related to COVID-19. This knowledge helps us create more equitable public health policies and prevention strategies. Using multiple sources, CDC data show that the risks for COVID-19 illness, hospitalization, and death differ by race and ethnicity.
American Indian and Alaska Native people were 3.7 times more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized and 2.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19 infection.
Black or African American people were 2.9 times more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized and 1.9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 infection.
Hispanic and Latino people were 3.1 times more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized and 2.3 times more likely to die from COVID-19 infection.
Among people under the age of 25, a study released this week found that COVID-19 case incidence disparities were higher among most racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly earlier in 2020. To track disparities, CDC provides race and ethnicity data for cases and deaths, and vaccinations. New dashboards on COVID Data Tracker display changes in the impact of the pandemic over time by race and ethnicity.
Social determinants of health contribute to racial and ethnic minority groups being disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Discrimination, which includes racism and associated chronic stress, influences each of these social determinants as well. We all have a role to play and must work together to ensure that people have resources to maintain and manage their physical and mental health, including easy access to information, affordable testing, vaccinations, and medical care.
Reported CasesFrom January 11 through February 26, the 7-day average of newly reported cases declined daily. From February 27 through March 1, 2021, the 7-day average increased daily; however, as of March 2, the 7-day average of new cases began to decline again. Since the highest 7-day average of 249,378 on January 11, 2021, the 7-day moving average decreased 78.1%. On March 10, there was a 11.2% decrease in the 7-day average number of daily cases reported compared with the prior week, which provides an encouraging sign of continued progress. Even with these declines, the 56,586 cases reported on March 10, 2021, is higher than the 42,597 cases reported during the first peak in the pandemic on April 6, 2020.
Jurisdictions have submitted historical corrections in the past 2 weeks, which influence the 7-day moving averages and percent change of the 7-day moving averages. Thus, the table below represents the new cases (not historical), the current and previous 7-day averages, and the percent change in the 7-day average with these historical data excluded. These historical corrections are included in the total cases below.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsCDC is closely tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Three variants of concern have been detected in the United States: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. A total of 3,701 B.1.1.7 variant cases have been reported in 50 jurisdictions. One hundred eight cases attributed to B.1.351 in 23 jurisdictions and 17 cases attributed to P.1 in 10 jurisdictions have also been detected in the United States. CDC and partners are increasing the numbers of specimens sequenced in laboratories around the country. The number of variants reported will likely increase as more specimens are sequenced and if the frequency of variants increases. Studies are underway to determine whether variants are more transmissible, cause more severe illness, or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14. As of March 10, 2021, 95.7 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 62.5 million people, or 18.8% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 32.9 million people, or 9.9% of the U.S. population have been fully vaccinated.*  As of March 10, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 2.2 million, an 8% increase from the previous week. Data by type of vaccine, which now includes the J&J/Janssen vaccine, are available on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker.

NotesThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.
CDC’s website also provides new data views such as county-specific summaries (under “Your Community” in Data Tracker), vaccination trends (under “Your Community” in Data Tracker), and information on SARS-CoV-2 variants.
