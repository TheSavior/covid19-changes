Interpretive Summary for May 21, 2021
Summer, Sun, and Safe Fun
resize iconView LargerClosedownload iconDownload Image[JPG]
COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are going down, and the number of people vaccinated continues to go up, providing a sense of optimism as summer approaches. As of May 20, 48.4% of the U.S. population ages 18 years and older is fully vaccinated, and 60.5% have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, as of last week, millions more are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. These trends and new CDC evidence-based guidance on masking provide encouragement that we are making progress toward returning to a sense of normalcy.
As you look ahead to summer, consider how COVID-19 is spreading in your community when choosing activities. Outdoor activities and visits are safer than those indoors, but fully vaccinated people can participate in most indoor activities without much risk. If you are not yet vaccinated, you should continue to practice prevention strategies such as wearing a well-fitted mask, practicing physical distancing, avoiding crowds, and washing your hands.
For more than a year, many people have focused on staying safe from COVID-19. While this continues to be important, returning to regular activities when you are fully vaccinated, such as travel, events, and other social gatherings, can provide hope for the days ahead. In addition, taking simple actions such as deep breathing, physical activity, healthy eating, practicing good sleep habits, and safely connecting with family, friends, and neighbors can improve your well-being.
Reported CasesThe current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (27,789) decreased 19.5% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (34,502). Compared with the highest peak on January 8, 2021 (252,768), the current 7-day average decreased 89.0%. A total of 32,855,010 COVID-19 cases have been reported as of May 19.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsMultiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally and within the United States. To date, five variants have been classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Nowcast estimates* of SARS-CoV-2 cases caused by these VOCs for the two weeks ending May 8 are summarized here. Nationally, B.1.1.7 proportions are predicted to increase to 74%; P.1 proportions are predicted to increase to 7%; B.1.427/B.1.429 proportions are predicted to increase; and B.1.351 proportions are predicted to decrease. Nowcast estimates predict that B.1.1.7 proportions will increase to more than 60% in all but HHS region 1. B.1.351 is predicted to increase in regions 3, 4, 9, and 10; P.1 is predicted to increase in all regions; and B.1.427/429 will be highest in regions 9 and 10. B.1.617.2, a new variant of interest, is predicted to be highest in regions 1, 6, 8, and 9.
*Current nowcast estimates are modeled data based on sequencing data from previous weeks. Nowcast provides timely estimates for the present, while accounting for limited sequence data availability, as specimens from the most current time interval are still being processed.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14, 2020. As of May 20, 279.4 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 160.2 million people, or 48.2% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 126.6 million people, or 38.1% of the total U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated.* As of May 20, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 1.8 million, a 12.5% decrease from the previous week.
The COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of May 19, 84.9% of people ages 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 73.2% are fully vaccinated. Over half (60.5%) of people ages 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 48.4% are fully vaccinated.

New admissions are pulled from a 10 am EST snapshot of the HHS Unified Hospital Timeseries Dataset. Due to potential reporting delays, data from the most recent 7 days, as noted in the figure above with the grey bar, should be interpreted with caution. Small shifts in historic data may also occur due to changes in the CMS Provider of Services file, which is used to identify the cohort of included hospitals.

COVID-NET: Recent Trends in Hospitalizations in Non-Hispanic Black Persons
Since the start of the pandemic, people from racial and ethnic minority groups have been at increased risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations compared to non-Hispanic White persons. While rates of hospitalizations have fallen in all race and ethnicity groups since January 2021, the hospitalization rate for non-Hispanic Black persons remains higher than other groups and has been nearly twice as high as rates in non-Hispanic White persons since late January. After falling in January and February 2021, hospitalization rates increased again in all groups beginning in early March. The weekly rate of hospitalizations for non-Hispanic Black persons reached 17.3 per 100,000 population for the week ending April 17, double the rate for non-Hispanic White persons (7.9 per 100,000 population for the same week). While preliminary data for late April and early May show rates again decreasing for all groups, the hospitalization rate in non-Hispanic Black persons remains one of the highest.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associate­­d Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are  collected using a standardized case reporting form.
