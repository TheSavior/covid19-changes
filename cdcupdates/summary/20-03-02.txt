Interpretative Summary for February 26, 2021
Safer Communities Mean Safer Schools
Almost a year ago, as the COVID-19 pandemic started affecting our communities, schools throughout the country turned to virtual learning to help protect students, teachers, school staff, and their families. Today, schools use different strategies to prevent spread. Some teach class online, while others have opened safely and conduct in-person learning using multiple prevention strategies, even in areas with relatively high levels of community spread. Recent studies in schools that strictly followed multiple prevention strategies found that most cases in schools came from community spread of disease, not from spread within the school itself.1,2,3 This means that each community has an opportunity to help schools return to in-person learning and make them safer by making their own community safer. How do we do that?
There are three important areas where we need to focus our attention to make communities safer.
1) Prevent spread to make your community safer
CDC recently published guidance for schools that highlights the critical need for communities to reduce spread to ensure a safe return to school and other activities. Communities that reduce the level of COVID-19 spread will foster greater opportunities for schools to safely return to in-person learning. Here are 6 steps to a safer community that each of us can do:
Wear a well-fitting mask
Stay 6 feet apart
Avoid gatherings
Wash hands often
Stay home when you are sick
Get vaccinated when vaccine is available to you

2) Increase testing
The number of COVID-19 tests people are getting continues to decline nationally. The average volume of tests over a seven-day period is down 20.2% from last week. Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested. Anyone who has been around someone with COVID-19 should also be tested. Additionally, last week the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announcedexternal icon efforts to expand COVID-19 testing for schools and people living and gathering in group settings, such as homeless shelters. By increasing testing, we can quickly identify people who have COVID-19 and isolate them from others, take steps to prevent further spread, and better address the threat of variants.
3) Continue rapid vaccination scale-up
Vaccination rates continue to increase and as of February 25, 2021, 13.9% of the U.S. population has received one or more doses of the vaccine. Additional data were released this week to visually show how many people in each state and nationally have been vaccinated. Vaccinating more adults, including essential workers such as teachers and educational staff, is critical to curbing the pandemic.
Reported CasesThere has been a six-week downward trend in cases. The highest 7-day average of 249,303 occurred on January 11, 2021. The current 7-day average is 66,348 cases, a 73.4% decline. The 13.5% decrease in the 7-day average number of daily cases reported compared with the prior week provides an encouraging sign of recent progress. Even with these declines, the 74,806 cases reported on February 24 remains much higher than what was seen during the first peak in the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsCDC is closely tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Three variants of concern have been detected in the United States: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. A total of 2,102 B.1.1.7 variant cases have been reported in 45 jurisdictions. Forty-nine cases with B.1.351 in 15 jurisdictions and six cases with P.1 in five states have also been detected in the United States. CDC and partners are increasing the numbers of specimens sequenced in laboratories around the country. The number of variants reported will likely increase as more specimens are sequenced and if the frequency of variants increases. Studies are underway to determine whether variants cause more severe illness or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination.

TestingThe number of COVID-19 tests that come back positive (percent positivity) continues to decline. The 7-day average of percent positivity from RT-PCR tests is now 5.2%. Four states or territories remain at 10% positivity or higher. The 7-day average test volume for February 12-18, 2021 was 1,066,213, down 20.2% from 1,335,763 the prior 7 days.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14. As of February 25, 2021, 68.3 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 46.1 million people, or 13.9% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 21.6 million people, or 6.5% of the U.S. population, have received two doses of vaccine. As of February 25, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 1.5 million, a 7.1% decrease from the previous week likely due to weather events.

NotesThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.
CDC’s website also provides new data views such as county-specific summaries (under “Your Community” in Data Tracker), vaccination trends (under “Your Community” in Data Tracker), and information on SARS-CoV-2 variants.
