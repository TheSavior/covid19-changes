On May 10, 2021, the Food and Drug Administrationexternal icon (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for use in adolescents ages 12-15 years. On May 14, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation in support of the EUA for the prevention of COVID-19 in adolescents ages 12-15 years. Additionally, CDC recently announced that fully vaccinated people, including adolescents, no longer need to wear masks in most situations. These announcements come as many families are looking forward to summer plans, including camp, youth sports, and travel. Authorization also comes as young people make up a rising proportion of new coronavirus cases in the United States.
Vaccinating adolescents is an important step toward stopping the spread of COVID-19. Yet, adolescent vaccination has been met with mixed reactions, with some parents eager to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, and others expressing hesitancy. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was found to be safe and effective in adolescents between the ages of 12-15 years in clinical trials. Side effects were generally consistent with those experienced by people ages 16-25 years. Side effects are typically normal signs that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of many people, including adolescents. But as more people become eligible for vaccination, we have reason to be hopeful. In addition to preventing severe illness, COVID-19 vaccines will help adolescents safely return to doing the things they love – whether that’s school, sports and other extracurricular activities, or socializing with friends. If you or someone you know is considering adolescent COVID-19 vaccination, talk with your pediatrician or family physician about the benefits of vaccination. CDC also has resources on credible vaccine information, and support for teens and young adults facing challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reported CasesThe current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (35,442) decreased 23.6% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (46,390). Compared with the highest peak on January 8, 2021 (250,037), the current 7-day average decreased 85.8%. A total of 32,643,851 COVID-19 cases have been reported as of May 12.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsNowcast estimates are now available on COVID Data Tracker. Current nowcast estimates are modeled data based on sequencing data from previous weeks. Nowcast provides timely estimates for the present, while accounting for limited sequence data availability, as specimens from the most current time interval are still being processed.
Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally and within the United States. To date, five variants have been classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Nowcast estimates of SARS-CoV-2 cases caused by these VOCs for the two weeks ending May 8 are summarized here. Nationally, B.1.1.7 proportions are predicted to increase to 72.4%; P.1 proportions are predicted to increase to 6.2%; B.1.427/B.1.429 proportions are predicted to decrease; and B.1.351 proportions are predicted to decrease. Nowcast estimates predict that B.1.1.7 proportions will increase to more than 60% in HHS regions 3 – 10. B.1.351 is predicted to increase in regions 3 and 10; P.1 is predicted to increase in all regions except 7 and 8; and B.1.427/429 will be highest in regions 9 and 10. B.1.617.2, a new variant of interest, is predicted to increase in regions 2, and 7 – 9.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14, 2020. As of May 13, 266.6 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 154.6 million people, or 46.6% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 119 million people, or 35.8% of the total U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated.* As of May 13, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 2.09 million, a 0.06% increase from the previous week.
The COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of May 13, 84.0% of people ages 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 71.8% are fully vaccinated. Over one-half (58.9%) of people ages 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 45.6% are fully vaccinated.

New admissions are pulled from a 10 am EST snapshot of the HHS Unified Hospital Timeseries Dataset. Due to potential reporting delays, data from the most recent 7 days, as noted in the figure above with the grey bar, should be interpreted with caution. Small shifts in historic data may also occur due to changes in the CMS Provider of Services file, which is used to identify the cohort of included hospitals.

COVID-NET: Trends in Hospitalizations in Children 5-17 years, including adolescents ages 12-17 years
Children ages 5-17 years have the lowest hospitalization rate of all age groups; however, children can experience severe illness and hospitalization associated with COVID-19. Hospitalization rates in adolescents ages 12-17 are comparable to those among children ages 0-4 years, and higher than those among children ages 5-11 years.
Among children ages 5-17 years, weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization peaked at 1.3 per 100,000 persons in early January, then decreased to 0.4 per 100,000 persons in mid-March. However, data from late March and April show that hospitalization rates have steadily increased among children ages 5-17 years, increasing more than 200% since mid-March to 0.9 per 100,000 persons by late April. Hospitalization rates have increased in all pediatric age groups.
Rising hospitalization rates in children highlight the need for continuing prevention efforts, including mask-wearing and physical distancing. Now that COVID-19 vaccination is authorized for adolescents ages 12 years and older, implementation of COVID-19 vaccines for all eligible people is another critical tool to reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in children.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associate­­d Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are  collected using a standardized case reporting form.
