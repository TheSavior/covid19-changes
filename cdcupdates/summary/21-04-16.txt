Interpretive Summary for April 16, 2021
It’s Complicated (but the Basics Still Work)
We are in a complicated stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Americans are being vaccinated every day at an accelerated pace. As of April 15, 2021, more than 125 million Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine, and more than 78 million Americans are fully vaccinated. And yet, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are increasing in some areas of the country, and among younger people who have not yet been vaccinated. The reasons for these increases are complicated but potentially related to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that are becoming predominant in some communities.
Nationally, COVID-19-related emergency department visits as well as both hospital admissions and current hospitalizations have risen among patients ages 18 to 64 years in recent weeks. The good news is that emergency department visits and hospitalizations among people ages 65 years and older have decreased, likely demonstrating the important role vaccination plays in protecting against COVID-19. As of April 15, 80% of people 65 years or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 63.7% are fully vaccinated.
As access to vaccines for all Americans increases, we have reason to be hopeful. However, until more of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, consistent use of prevention strategies, such as universal and correct use of masks, social distancing, and hand washing, will help to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Even if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking these everyday precautions in public places.
Reported CasesOverall, the 7-day average of new cases has generally increased since March 20, 2021. The current 7-day moving average of daily new cases (69,577) increased 8.1% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (64,340). Compared with the highest peak on January 11, 2021 (249,861), the current 7-day average decreased 72.2%. A total of 31,231,869 COVID-19 cases were reported as of April 14, 2021, including 73,622 new cases.

SARS-CoV-2 VariantsCDC recently updated the COVID Data Tracker to include the most recent proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants nationally and in states where there is enough data for CDC to monitor variants. The Variant Surveillance Section of the COVID Data Tracker provides an overview of published sequencing data and a global variant report map by country.
To paint a clearer picture of how prevalent specific variants are in the United States, CDC analyzes available genomic sequence data from specimens of SARS-CoV-2 collected from patients. These data are weighted to account for known differences in diagnostic testing and sequencing across time and geography. Based on specimens collected through March 27, an estimated 44.1% of COVID-19 cases in the United States are caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7. The proportion of cases caused by B.1.429 is estimated at 6.9%, and the proportion of cases caused by B.1.427 is estimated at 2.9%. Variant P.1 is estimated to comprise 1.4% of COVID-19 cases, and the proportion of B.1.351 cases is estimated to be 0.7% for the end of March.
CDC and partners are increasing the numbers of specimens sequenced in laboratories around the country. Studies are underway to determine whether variants are more transmissible, cause more severe illness, or are likely to evade immunity brought on by prior illness or vaccination.

TestingThe percentage of COVID-19 RT-PCR tests that are positive (percent positivity) has increased from the previous week. The 7-day average of percent positivity from tests is now 5.6%. The 7-day average test volume for April 2-April 8, 2021, was 1,152,186, down 3.7% from 1,195,920 for the prior 7 days.

VaccinationsThe U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program began December 14, 2020. As of April 15, 2021, 198.3 million vaccine doses have been administered. Overall, about 125.8 million people, or 37.9% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine. About 78.5 million people, or 23.6% of the U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated.* As of April 15, the 7-day average number of administered vaccine doses reported to CDC per day was 3.3 million, a 10.3% increase from the previous week.
The COVID Data Tracker Vaccination Demographic Trends tab shows vaccination trends by age group. As of April 15, 80% of people ages 65 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 63.7% are fully vaccinated. Nearly one half (48.3%) of people ages 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 30.3% are fully vaccinated.

HospitalizationsNew Hospital Admissions
While new admissions have decreased considerably since their January peaks, the 7-day moving average has now been increasing for approximately 3 weeks. The current 7-day average for April 7–April 13, 2021, was 5,507. This is a 4.5% increase from the prior 7-day average (5,269) from March 31–April 6, 2021.

Trends in Hospitalization Rates by Age Group
Older adults are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including an increased risk for hospitalization. Since the start of the pandemic, adults ages 65 years and older were the age group with the highest rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. While rates of hospitalization have fallen for all age groups since the peak in early January 2021, the rates for adults ages 65 years and older have fallen the most. Rates of hospitalization among adults ages 65 years and older have decreased by more than 70% in the past two months, from 70.5 per 100,000 in early January to less than 20 per 100,000 in recent weeks. However, rates have plateaued or risen in recent weeks in all age groups.

New admissions are pulled from a 10 am EST snapshot of the HHS Unified Hospital Timeseries Dataset. Due to potential reporting delays, data from the most recent 7 days should be interpreted with caution. Small shifts in historic data may also occur due to changes in the CMS Provider of Services file, which is used to identify the cohort of included hospitals.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) is an additional source for hospitalization data collected through a network of more than 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states (representing ~10% of the U.S. population). Detailed data on patient demographics, including race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes, are collected using a standardized case reporting form.
