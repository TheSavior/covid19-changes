Chinese health officials have reported more than a thousand infections with 2019-nCoV in China, including outside of Hubei Province. Infections with 2019-nCoV also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the\xa0United States, where 5 cases in travelers from Wuhan have been confirmed in four states (AZ, CA, IL, WA) as of January 26, 2020.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. On January 24, 2020, CDC posted in GenBank the full genome of the 2019-nCoV virus detected in the first U.S. patient from Washington state. The virus genetic sequence from the patient in Washington is nearly identical to the sequences posted from China. The available sequences suggest a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus. The available sequence information does not provide any information about severity of associated illness or transmissibility of the virus.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, and there is evidence that person-to-person spread is occurring.

Chinese health officials have reported thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in many parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declare the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). A PHEIC is declared if an event poses a public health threat to other nations through the spread of disease and potentially requires a coordinated international response.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with 2019-nCoV.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the 2019-nCoV viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\n2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, all of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries. In addition, cases asymptomatic spread of the virus have been reported. Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.\nSituation in U.S.\nImported cases of 2019-nCoV infection in people have been detected in the U.S. While person-to-person spread among close contacts has been detected with this virus, at this time this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.\nOn This Page\nBackgroundSource and Spread of the VirusSituation in U.S.Illness SeverityRisk AssessmentWhat to ExpectCDC ResponseCDC RecommendsOther Available Resources\n2019-nCoV in the U.S.\nView larger image\nConfirmed 2019-nCoV Cases Globally\nView larger image and see a list of locations\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people.

Chinese health officials have reported thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in many parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to 2019-nCoV. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon\u201c.

Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with 2019-nCoV.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the 2019-nCoV viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\n2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, all of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries. In addition, cases asymptomatic spread of the virus have been reported.

Learn more about the symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThis is a very serious public health threat. The fact that this virus has caused severe illness and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning, but it\u2019s unclear how the situation in the United States will unfold at this time.\nThe risk to individuals is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low. The goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to prevent sustained spread of 2019-nCov in this country.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\nCDC Response\nCDC is closely monitoring this situation and is working with WHO and state and local public health partners to respond to this emerging public health threat.\nThe goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to prevent sustained spread of 2019-nCov in this country.\nCDC established a 2019-nCoV Incident Management Structure on January 7, 2020.

Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to 2019-nCoV. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon\u201c. These measures were announced at a press\xa0briefing\xa0by members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Forceexternal icon.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with 2019-nCoV.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the 2019-nCoV viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\n2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries.

Measures to detect this virus among those who are allowed entry into the United States (U.S. citizens, residents and family) who have been in China within 14 days also are being implemented.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people.

Learn more about the symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by 2019-nCoV virus is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this virus has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts of 2019-nCoV patients. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low at this time.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States.

Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to 2019-nCoV. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon\u201c. These measures were announced at a press\xa0briefing\xa0by members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Forceexternal icon.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with 2019-nCoV.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the 2019-nCoV viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\n2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries.

Measures to detect this virus among those who are allowed entry into the United States (U.S. citizens, residents and family) who have been in China within 14 days also are being implemented.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to 2019-nCoV is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including resulting in death. Learn more about the symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by 2019-nCoV virus is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this virus has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts of 2019-nCoV patients. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low at this time.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\nCDC Response\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. Infections with 2019-nCoV, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to 2019-nCoV. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon\u201c. These measures were announced at a press\xa0briefing\xa0by members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Forceexternal icon.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with 2019-nCoV.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the 2019-nCoV viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\n2019-nCoV is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries.

Learn more about the symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by 2019-nCoV virus is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this virus has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts of 2019-nCoV patients.

The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 virus is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this virus has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of patients with COVID-19. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\nCDC Response\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nChinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. COVID-19 illnesses, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. Also on January 31, the President of the United States signed a presidential \u201cProclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirusexternal icon.\u201d These measures were announced at a press\xa0briefing\xa0by members of the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Forceexternal icon.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS, SARS, and now with this new virus (named SARS-COV2).\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nChinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the SARS-COV2 virus in\xa0GenBankexternal icon, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAIDexternal icon) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. CDC is posting the full genome of the SARS-COV2 viruses detected in U.S. patients to GenBank as sequencing is completed.\nThe SARS-COV2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARs, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries.

The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of patients with COVID-19. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\nCDC Response\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications).\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States. The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. It\u2019s unclear how the situation will unfold, but risk is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of patients with COVID-19. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low at this time.\nWhat to Expect\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.\nCDC Response\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nChinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of that country. COVID-19 illnesses, most of them associated with travel from Wuhan, also are being reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States. Some person-to-person spread of this virus outside China has been detected. The United States reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread with this virus on January 30, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.

Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, both of which have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other countries. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. In addition, other destinations have apparent community spread, meaning some people have been infected who are not sure how or where they became infected.

The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States.\nBut individual risk is dependent on exposure.\nFor the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\nUnder current circumstances, certain people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of persons with COVID-19. CDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic.

It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States. Widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing spread of this virus and mitigating the impact of this virus.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other locations. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. In addition, other destinations have apparent community spread, meaning some people have been infected who are not sure how or where they became infected. Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.\nOn This Page\nBackgroundSource and Spread of the VirusSituation in U.S.Illness SeverityRisk AssessmentWhat May HappenCDC ResponseHighlights of CDC\u2019s ResponseCDC RecommendsOther Available Resources\nConfirmed COVID-19 Cases Global Map\nView larger image and see a list of locations\nmap iconCOVID-19 cases in the U.S.\nSituation in U.S.\nImported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S.\xa0Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 also has been seen among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan, but at this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Learn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nThe potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States.\nBut individual risk is dependent on exposure.\nFor the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\nUnder current circumstances, certain people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other close contacts of persons with COVID-19. CDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. In that case, the risk assessment would be different.\nWhat May Happen\nMore cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States. Widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing spread of this virus and mitigating the impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.

It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States. Widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it.

The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. The public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States so as to reduce the spread and the impact of this virus.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread has been reported outside China, including in the United States and other locations. Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China. In addition, other destinations have apparent community spread, meaning some people have been infected who are not sure how or where they became infected.

Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Learn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nWhile there is still much to learn about the unfolding situations in California, Oregon and Washington, preliminary information raises the level of concern about the immediate threat for COVID-19 for certain communities in the United States. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is very high, to the United States and globally.\nAt this time, however, most people in the United States will have little immediate risk of exposure to this virus. This virus is NOT currently spreading widely in the United States. However, it is important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment will be updated as needed.\nCurrent risk assessment:\nFor the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\nPeople in communities where ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated though still relatively low risk of exposure.\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.\nClose contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nTravelers returning from affected international locations\xa0where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nCDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nWhat May Happen\nMore cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It\u2019s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur.\nWidespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions\xa0would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing the spread and mitigating the impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. The public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States. CDC is operationalizing all of its pandemic preparedness and response plans, working on multiple fronts to meet these goals, including specific measures to prepare communities to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. There is an abundance of pandemic guidance\xa0developed in anticipation of an influenza pandemic that is being repurposed and adapted for a COVID-19 pandemic.\nHighlights of CDC\u2019s Response\nCDC established a COVID-19 Incident Management System on January 7, 2020. On January 21, CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response.\nThe U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps with respect to travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus:\nEffective February 2, at 5pm, the U.S. government suspended entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days.\nU.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been in Hubei province and other parts of mainland China are allowed to enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days.\nOn February 29, the U.S. government announced it was suspending entry of foreign nationals who have been in Iran within the past 14 days.\nCDC has issued the following travel guidance related to COVID-19:\nChina \u2014 Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel \u2014 updated February 22;\nHong Kong \u2014 Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions \u2014 issued February 19;\nIran \u2014 Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel\xa0\u2014 updated February 28;\nItaly \u2014 Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel\xa0\u2014 updated February 28;\nJapan \u2014 Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions\xa0\u2014 updated February 22;\nSouth Korea \u2014 Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel \u2014 updated February 24.\nCDC also recommends that all travelers reconsider cruise ship voyages into or within Asia\xa0at this time.\nCDC is issuing clinical guidance, including:\nOn January 30, CDC published guidance for healthcare professionals on the clinical care of \xa0COVID-19 patients.\nOn February 3, CDC posted guidance for assessing the potential risk for various exposures\xa0to COVID-19 and managing those people appropriately.\nOn February 27, CDC updated its criteria to guide evaluation of persons under investigation for COVID-19.\nOn February 28, CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN): Update and Interim Guidance on Outbreak of COVID-19.\nCDC has deployed multidisciplinary teams to support state health departments case identification, contact tracing, clinical management, and communications.\nCDC has worked with the Department of State, supporting the safe return of Americans who have been stranded as a result of the ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have apparent community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, meaning some people have been infected who are not sure how or where they became infected.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have apparent community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, including in some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn what is known about the spread of this newly emerged coronaviruses.\nOn This Page\nBackgroundSource and Spread of the VirusSituation in U.S.Illness SeverityRisk AssessmentWhat May HappenCDC ResponseHighlights of CDC\u2019s ResponseCDC RecommendsOther Available Resources\nConfirmed COVID-19 Cases Global Map\nView larger image and see a list of locations\nmap iconCOVID-19 cases in the U.S.\nSituation in U.S.\nImported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S.\nPerson-to-person spread of COVID-19 was first reported among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan.\nDuring the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California (in two places), Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a reportexternal icon out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people with certain underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, seem to be at greater risk of serious illness.\nLearn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nReported community spread of COVID-19 in parts of the United States raises the level of concern about the immediate threat for COVID-19 for those communities. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is very high, to the United States and globally.\nAt this time, however, most people in the United States will have little immediate risk of exposure to this virus. This virus is NOT currently spreading widely in the United States. However, it is important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment will be updated as needed.\nCurrent risk assessment:\nFor most of the American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\nPeople in communities where ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated, though still relatively low risk of exposure.\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.\nClose contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nTravelers returning from affected international locations\xa0where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nCDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nWhat May Happen\nMore cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It\u2019s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur.\nWidespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions\xa0would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing the spread and mitigating the impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. The public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States. CDC is operationalizing all of its pandemic preparedness and response plans, working on multiple fronts to meet these goals, including specific measures to prepare communities to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have apparent community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, including in some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn what is known about the spread of this newly emerged coronaviruses.\nOn This Page\nBackgroundSource and Spread of the VirusSituation in U.S.Illness SeverityRisk AssessmentWhat May HappenCDC ResponseHighlights of CDC\u2019s ResponseCDC RecommendsOther Available Resources\nConfirmed COVID-19 Cases Global Map\nView larger image and see a list of locations\nmap iconCOVID-19 cases in the U.S.\nSituation in U.S.\nImported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S.\nPerson-to-person spread of COVID-19 was first reported among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan.\nDuring the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California (in two places), Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.\nIllness Severity\nBoth MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a reportexternal icon out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people with certain underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, seem to be at greater risk of serious illness.\nLearn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). The fact that this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nReported community spread of COVID-19 in parts of the United States raises the level of concern about the immediate threat for COVID-19 for those communities. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is very high, to the United States and globally.\nAt this time, however, most people in the United States will have little immediate risk of exposure to this virus. This virus is NOT currently spreading widely in the United States. However, it is important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment will be updated as needed.\nCurrent risk assessment:\nFor most of the American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.\nPeople in communities where ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated, though still relatively low risk of exposure.\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.\nClose contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nTravelers returning from affected international locations\xa0where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nCDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nWhat May Happen\nMore cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It\u2019s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur.\nWidespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions\xa0would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing the spread and mitigating the impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. The public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States. CDC is operationalizing all of its pandemic preparedness and response plans, working on multiple fronts to meet these goals, including specific measures to prepare communities to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. There is an abundance of pandemic guidance\xa0developed in anticipation of an influenza pandemic that is being repurposed and adapted for a COVID-19 pandemic.\nHighlights of CDC\u2019s Response\nCDC established a COVID-19 Incident Management System on January 7, 2020.

The virus has been named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d and the disease it causes has been named \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (abbreviated \u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concernexternal icon\u201d (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.\nSource and Spread of the Virus\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. \xa0All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nEarly on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Some international destinations now have apparent community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as do some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn what is known about the spread of this newly emerged coronaviruses.\nOn This Page\nBackgroundSource and Spread of the VirusSituation in U.S.Illness SeverityRisk AssessmentWhat May HappenCDC ResponseHighlights of CDC\u2019s ResponseCDC RecommendsOther Available Resources\nConfirmed COVID-19 Cases Global Map\nView larger image and see a list of locations\nmap iconCOVID-19 cases in the U.S.\nSituation in U.S.\nIn addition to CDC, many public health laboratories are now testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. View CDC\u2019s Public Health Laboratory Testing map.\nWith this increase in testing, now 19 states have reported cases of COVID-19 to CDC. View latest case counts, deaths, and a map of states with reported cases.\nU.S. COVID-19 cases include:\nImported cases in travelers\nCases among close contacts of a known case\nCommunity-acquired cases where the source of the infection is unknown.\nIllness Severity\nThe complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known. Reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a reportexternal icon out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions \u2014 like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example \u2014 seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.\nLearn more about the symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nThere are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nRisk Assessment\nOutbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk to the general public from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness). That this disease has caused severe illness, including illness resulting in death is concerning, especially since it has also shown sustained person-to-person spread in several places. These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic. As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria, worldwide spread of the new virus.\nIt is important to note that current circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation and CDC\u2019s risk assessment will be updated as needed.\nCurrent risk assessment:\nFor most people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low. This virus is not currently widespread in the United States.\nPeople in places where ongoing community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated risk of exposure, with increase in risk dependent on the location.\nHealthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.\nClose contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.\nTravelers returning from affected international locations\xa0where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure, with increase in risk dependent on the location.\nCDC has developed guidance to help in the risk assessment and management\xa0of people with potential exposures to COVID-19.\nWhat May Happen\nMore cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It\u2019s also likely that sustained person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including throughout communities in the United States. It\u2019s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur.\nWidespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, and workplaces, may experience more absenteeism. Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected. Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions\xa0would be the most important response strategy.\nCDC Response\nGlobal efforts at this time are focused concurrently on containing the spread and mitigating the impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat. The public health response is multi-layered, with the goal of detecting and minimizing introductions of this virus in the United States. CDC is implementing all of its pandemic preparedness and response plans, working on multiple fronts to meet these goals, including specific measures to prepare communities\xa0to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. There is an abundance of pandemic guidance\xa0developed in anticipation of an influenza pandemic that is being adapted for a potential COVID-19 pandemic.\nHighlights of CDC\u2019s Response\nCDC established a COVID-19 Incident Management System on January 7, 2020. On January 21, CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response.\nThe U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps with respect to travel in response to the growing public health threat posed by this new coronavirus:\nOn February 2, the U.S. government suspended entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days.\nU.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been in Hubei province and other parts of mainland China are allowed to enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days.\nOn February 29, the U.S. government announced it was suspending entry of foreign nationals who have been in Iran within the past 14 days.\nCDC has issued the following travel guidance related to COVID-19.\nCDC has issued clinical guidance, including:\nOn January 30, CDC published guidance for healthcare professionals on the clinical care of \xa0COVID-19 patients.\nOn February 3, CDC posted guidance for assessing the potential risk for various exposures\xa0to COVID-19 and managing those people appropriately.\nOn February 27, CDC updated its criteria to guide evaluation of persons under investigation for COVID-19.\nOn February 28, CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN): Update and Interim Guidance on Outbreak of COVID-19.\nCDC has deployed multidisciplinary teams to support state health departments case identification, contact tracing, clinical management, and public communications.\nCDC has worked with the Department of State, supporting the safe return of Americans who have been stranded as a result of the ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. CDC has worked to assess the health of passengers as they return to the United States and provided continued daily monitoring of people who are quarantined.\nThis is a picture of CDC\u2019s laboratory test kit for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

CDC is working with FDA to amend the existing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the test, but in the meantime, FDA granted discretionary authority for the use of the original test kits.\nPublic health laboratories can use the original CDC test kit to test for the virus that causes COVID-19 using the new protocol.\nFurther, newly manufactured kits have been provided to the International Reagent Resourceexternal icon for distribution to state and local public health labs.\nCombined with other reagents that CDC has procured, there are enough testing kits to test more than 75,000 people.\nIn addition, CDC has two laboratories conducting testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC can test approximately 350 specimens per day.\nCommercial labs are working to develop their own tests that hopefully will be available soon. This will allow a greater number of tests to happen close to where potential cases are.\nCDC has grown the COVID-19 virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. The cell-grown virus was sent to NIH\u2019s BEI Resources Repositoryexternal icon\xa0for use by the broad scientific community.\nCDC Recommends\nEveryone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat:\nIt\u2019s currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine, taking everyday preventive actions\xa0to help stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.\nIndividuals and communities should familiarize themselves with recommendations to protect themselves and their communities\xa0from getting and spreading respiratory illnesses like coronavirus disease 2019.\nOlder people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions\xa0because they are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.\nIf you are a healthcare provider, be on the look-out for:\nPeople who recently traveled from China or another affected area\xa0and who have symptoms associated with COVID-19, and\nPeople who have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or patients with pneumonia of unknown cause. (Consult the most recent definition for patients under investigation [PUIs].)\nIf you are a healthcare provider or a public health responder caring for a COVID-19 patient, please take care of yourself and follow recommended infection control procedures.\nIf you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 and develop symptoms of COVID-19, call your healthcare provider and tell them about your symptoms and your exposure.\nIf you are a resident in a community where there is ongoing spread of COVID-19 and you develop COVID-19 symptoms, call your healthcare provider and tell them about your symptoms.\nFor people who are ill with COVID-19, but are not sick enough to be hospitalized, please follow CDC guidance on how to reduce the risk of spreading your illness to others. People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness.\nIf you have been in China or another affected area or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity\xa0.

Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being performed at state public health laboratories and CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.\nFor initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs).

The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset.

They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website. State and local health departments can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays. Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being performed at state public health laboratories and CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.\nFor initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset.

Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Decisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever1 and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such as influenza.\nEpidemiologic factors that may help guide decisions on whether to test include: any persons, including healthcare workers2, who have had close contact3 with a laboratory-confirmed4 COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset, or a history of travel from affected geographic areas5 (see below) within 14 days of symptom onset.\nInternational Areas with Sustained (Ongoing) Transmission\nLast updated February 28, 2020\nChina (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nIran (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nItaly (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nJapan (Level 2 Travel Health Notice)\nSouth Korea (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)\nRecommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection\nUpdated February 28, 2020\nClinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19. They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 website. State and local health departments can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays.\nFor initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset.

CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (76%\u201382%), and myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%) at illness onset. Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. The fever course among patients with 2019-nCoV infection is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities.\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness. Nearly all reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years). In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, 57% were male. Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days).\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection required intensive care for respiratory support. Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with invasive mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%). Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury (12%) and acute kidney injury (4\u20137%). Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as high as 11\u201315%. However, as this estimate includes only-hospitalized patients, and therefore is biased upward.\nDiagnostic Testing\nCurrently, confirmation of 2019-nCoV infection is performed at CDC using the CDC real-time RT-PCR assay for 2019-nCoV on respiratory specimens (which can include nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal aspirates or washes, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, broncheoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates, or sputum) and serum. Information on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of 2019-nCoV infection, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date.\n2019-nCoV RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The duration of shedding of 2019-nCoV RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tracts is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer, which has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.\nClinical Management and Treatment\nNo specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated. Corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions and eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. See Interim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment.

This update includes additional information regarding time from illness onset to hospital admission, detection of 2019-nCoV in extrapulmonary specimens, clarifies the type of advanced support observed among hospitalized patients and provides interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and in-home isolation. CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%), and shortness of breath (31%) at illness onset. [2\u20134] Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with 2019-nCoV infection is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. [5]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.\xa0 Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years).[1]\xa0 In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, 57% were male. [1] Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [2\u20133] In another study, compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3]\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2] In one report, among patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1]\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of 2019-nCoV infection, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%).

Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 6\u20139]\nLimited data are available about the detection of 2019-nCoV and infectious virus in clinical specimens. 2019-nCoV RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 2019-nCoV RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of 2019-nCoV RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.[9\u201318] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. [18\u201320]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nHealthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient.

Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infection at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against 2019-nCoV. [24] A small number of patients with 2019-nCoV infection have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 2019-nCoV infection has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trial of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 2019-nCoV infection in China, but no results are available to date. Clinical trials of other potential therapeutics for 2019-nCoV infection are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon.\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions or In-Home Isolation for Persons with Laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV Infection*\nStandard and Transmission-based precautions (i.e., Contact and Airborne precautions with eye protection) should be used for persons with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. This guidance applies to patients being managed in a hospital in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and to patients being cared for in-home isolation.\nDecisions to discontinue transmission-based precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens.\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with 2019-nCoV Infection\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Non-Hospitalized Patients with 2019-nCoV Infection Under In-Home Isolation\nAdditional resources:\nInterim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed 2019-nCoV\nInterim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus\nWorld Health Organization.

This update includes additional information regarding time from illness onset to hospital admission, detection of 2019-nCoV in extrapulmonary specimens, clarifies the type of advanced support observed among hospitalized patients and provides interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and in-home isolation. CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%), and shortness of breath (31%) at illness onset. [2\u20134] Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with 2019-nCoV infection is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. [5]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.\xa0 Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years).[1]\xa0 In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, 57% were male. [1] Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [2\u20133] In another study, compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3]\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2] In one report, among patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1]\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of 2019-nCoV infection, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 6\u20139]\nLimited data are available about the detection of 2019-nCoV and infectious virus in clinical specimens. 2019-nCoV RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 2019-nCoV RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of 2019-nCoV RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.[9\u201318] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. [18\u201320]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nHealthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. See Interim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV.\nNo specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

[2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection Coronavirus Disease 2019. After initial confirmation of COVID-19, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 6\u20139]\nLimited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.[9\u201318] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. [18\u201320]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nHealthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. See Interim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19.\nNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients. [12, 21\u201323]\nFor more information, see: WHO interim guidance on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspectedpdf iconexternal icon and Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal icon.\nInvestigational Therapeutics\nThere are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [24] A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trial of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. Clinical trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon.\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions or In-Home Isolation for Persons with Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19*\nStandard and Transmission-based precautions (i.e., Contact and Airborne precautions with eye protection) should be used for persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This guidance applies to patients being managed in a hospital in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and to patients being cared for in-home isolation.\nDecisions to discontinue transmission-based precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens.\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Under In-Home Isolation\nAdditional resources:\nInterim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19\nInterim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nWorld Health Organization.

This update includes additional information regarding time from illness onset to hospital admission, detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in extrapulmonary specimens, clarifies the type of advanced support observed among hospitalized patients and provides interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and in-home isolation. CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%), and shortness of breath (31%) at illness onset. [2\u20134] Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed COVID-19 and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. [5]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.\xa0 Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years).[1]\xa0 In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed COVID-19, 57% were male. [1] Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [2\u20133] In another study, compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3]\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1]\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection Coronavirus Disease 2019. After initial confirmation of COVID-19, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date.

This update includes additional information regarding time from illness onset to hospital admission, detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in extrapulmonary specimens, clarifies the type of advanced support observed among hospitalized patients and provides interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and in-home isolation. CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%), and shortness of breath (31%) at illness onset. [2\u20134] Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed COVID-19 and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. [5]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.\xa0 Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years).[1]\xa0 In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed COVID-19, 57% were male. [1] Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [2\u20133] In another study, compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3]\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1]\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection Coronavirus Disease 2019. After initial confirmation of COVID-19, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 6\u20139]\nLimited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.[9\u201318] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. [18\u201320]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nHealthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. See Interim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19.\nNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal icon.\nInvestigational Therapeutics\nThere are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [24] A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trial of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. Clinical trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon.\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions or In-Home Isolation for Persons with Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19*\nStandard and Transmission-based precautions (i.e., Contact and Airborne precautions with eye protection) should be used for persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This guidance applies to patients being managed in a hospital in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and to patients being cared for in-home isolation.\nDecisions to discontinue transmission-based precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens.\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Under In-Home Isolation\nAdditional resources:\nInterim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19\nInterim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nWorld Health Organization.

This update includes additional information regarding time from illness onset to hospital admission, detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in extrapulmonary specimens, clarifies the type of advanced support observed among hospitalized patients and provides interim guidance for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions and in-home isolation. CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available.\nClinical Presentation\nThere are a limited number of reports that describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, and most are limited to hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The incubation period is estimated at ~5 days (95% confidence interval, 4 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms include fever (83\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201344%), and shortness of breath (31%) at illness onset. [2\u20134] Sore throat has also been reported in some patients early in the clinical course. Less commonly reported symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. Asymptomatic infection has been described in one child with confirmed COVID-19 and chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. [5]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.\xa0 Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years).[1]\xa0 In one study of 425 patients with pneumonia and confirmed COVID-19, 57% were male. [1] Approximately one-third to one-half of reported patients had underlying medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [2\u20133] In another study, compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3]\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1]\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3] Between 23\u201332% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] In one study, among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11% received high-flow oxygen therapy, 42% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47% received mechanical ventilation. [3] Some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201310%), and a small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u20135%).[3\u20134] Other reported complications include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, shock, and acute kidney injury. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] However, as this estimate includes only hospitalized patients it is biased upward. Nosocomial transmission among healthcare personnel and patients has been reported.\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection Coronavirus Disease 2019. After initial confirmation of COVID-19, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 6\u20139]\nLimited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection.[9\u201318] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. [18\u201320]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nHealthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. See Interim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19.\nNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal icon.\nInvestigational Therapeutics\nThere are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [24] A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trial of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. Clinical trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon.\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions or In-Home Isolation for Persons with Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19*\nStandard and Transmission-based precautions (i.e., Contact and Airborne precautions with eye protection) should be used for persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This guidance applies to patients being managed in a hospital in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and to patients being cared for in-home isolation.\nDecisions to discontinue transmission-based precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens.\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19\nSee: Interim Considerations for Disposition of Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Under In-Home Isolation\nAdditional resources:\nInterim Guidance for Healthcare Professionals\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19\nInterim Health Care Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nWorld Health Organization.

The incubation period is estimated at 4 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201352%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset. [2\u20135] Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization. [6] \xa0Other less commonly reported respiratory symptoms include sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. A limited number of reports describe identification of asymptomatic or subclinical infection on the basis of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or live virus from throat swab specimens of contacts of confirmed patients. [7\u20138]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness. Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China as of Feb 11, 2020, most occurred among patients aged 30\u201369 years (77.8%), and approximately 19% were severely or critically ill [9]. Case-fatality proportion among cases aged \u226560 years was: 60-69 years: 3.6%; 70-79 years: 8%; \u226580 years: 14.8%. Patients who reported no underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7% for diabetes, and 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. Case fatality for patients who developed respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction was 49%. [9]\nLimited information is available about the clinical presentation, clinical course, and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. Of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China as of Feb 11, 2020, only 2.1% were aged <20 years, and no deaths were reported among those <10 years of age [9]. From limited published reports, signs and symptoms among children with COVID-19 may be more mild than adults, with most pediatric patients presenting with fever, cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea [10, 12\u201313], and one report of primarily gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) [13]. Prolonged detection of SARS-CoV RNA has been reported in respiratory specimens (up to 22 days after illness onset) and stool specimens (at least 30 days after illness onset) [10\u201311]. Severe complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock were reported in a 13-month old with COVID-19 in China [13].\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2,5] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3]\nApproximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] Compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3] Among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11\u201364% received high-flow oxygen therapy and 47-71% received mechanical ventilation; some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201342%).[3\u20134,9] A small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u201312%).[3\u20134,9] Other reported complications include cardiac injury, arrhythmia, septic shock, liver dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and multi-organ failure. Post-mortem biopsies in one patient who died of ARDS reported pulmonary findings of diffuse alveolar damage. [14]\nAn overall case fatality proportion of 2.3% has been reported among confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. [9] However, the majority of these cases were among hospitalized patients and therefore this estimate of mortality is likely biased upward. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] Among critically ill COVID-19 patients in China, the reported case fatality proportion was 49%. In a report from one hospital, 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died by day 28 of ICU admission. [9,15]\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of COVID-10, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Among 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytopenia was present in 83%; 36% had thrombocytopenia, and 34% had leukopenia. [6] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 16\u201324] However, one study that evaluated the time from symptom onset to initial CT scan found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days had a normal CT. [20]\nLimited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated in cell culture from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In one case series\xa0 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels in the first 3 days after symptom onset were higher in specimens collected from the nose than from the throat (as demonstrated by lower cycle threshold values in the nose). [25] A similar time course and pattern of viral RNA detection was reported in one asymptomatic patient after exposure to a patient with confirmed COVID-19. [25]\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. [26\u201329]. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could be detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. [30\u201337] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has been isolated only from respiratory tract specimens. [37\u201339]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nFor information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided, because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients, unless indicated for other reasons.

In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and collaborators are working on development of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time.\nRemdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug that was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [43]\xa0 Some patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. In China, multiple clinical trials of investigational therapeutics have been implemented, including two clinical trials of remdesivir. An NIH adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial external icon of investigational therapeutics for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States was approved by the Food and Drug Administration; the first investigational therapeutic to be studied is remdesivir. Other remdesivir trials for COVID-19 patients in the U.S. are available (participants with severeexternal icon and moderateexternal icon coronavirus disease). Some COVID-19 patients have received uncontrolled treatment with other investigational antivirals. [4, 28, 44] For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon, and www.chictr.org.cnexternal icon\nIn the absence of an approved vaccine, community mitigation measures are the primary way to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons in the community, and adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread in healthcare facilities. In the absence of an approved therapeutic with demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19 patients includes avoidance of corticosteroids, and supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support.\nDiscontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation\nFor recommendations on discontinuation of transmission-based precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see: Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 and  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19\nAdditional resources:\nEvaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19\nInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings\nWorld Health Organization.

The incubation period is estimated at 4 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). [1] Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days. Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77\u201398%), cough (46%\u201382%), myalgia or fatigue (11\u201352%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset. [2\u20135] Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization. [6] \xa0Other less commonly reported respiratory symptoms include sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. The fever course among patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood; it may be prolonged and intermittent. A limited number of reports describe identification of asymptomatic or subclinical infection on the basis of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or live virus from throat swab specimens of contacts of confirmed patients. [7\u20138]\nRisk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness. Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China as of Feb 11, 2020, most occurred among patients aged 30\u201369 years (77.8%), and approximately 19% were severely or critically ill [9]. Case-fatality proportion among cases aged \u226560 years was: 60-69 years: 3.6%; 70-79 years: 8%; \u226580 years: 14.8%. Patients who reported no underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7% for diabetes, and 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. Case fatality for patients who developed respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction was 49%. [9]\nLimited information is available about the clinical presentation, clinical course, and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. Of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China as of Feb 11, 2020, only 2.1% were aged <20 years, and no deaths were reported among those <10 years of age [9]. From limited published reports, signs and symptoms among children with COVID-19 may be more mild than adults, with most pediatric patients presenting with fever, cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea [10, 12\u201313], and one report of primarily gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) [13]. Prolonged detection of SARS-CoV RNA has been reported in respiratory specimens (up to 22 days after illness onset) and stool specimens (at least 30 days after illness onset) [10\u201311]. Severe complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock were reported in a 13-month old with COVID-19 in China [13].\nClinical Course\nClinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.[2,5] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5\u201313 days). [2] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.[1] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17\u201329% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. [2,4] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.[3]\nApproximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support.[2\u20133] Compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit, critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% versus 37%). [3] Among critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 11\u201364% received high-flow oxygen therapy and 47-71% received mechanical ventilation; some hospitalized patients have required advanced organ support with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (4\u201342%).[3\u20134,9] A small proportion have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 3\u201312%).[3\u20134,9] Other reported complications include cardiac injury, arrhythmia, septic shock, liver dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and multi-organ failure. Post-mortem biopsies in one patient who died of ARDS reported pulmonary findings of diffuse alveolar damage. [14]\nAn overall case fatality proportion of 2.3% has been reported among confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. [9] However, the majority of these cases were among hospitalized patients and therefore this estimate of mortality is likely biased upward. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4\u201315%.[2\u20134] Among critically ill COVID-19 patients in China, the reported case fatality proportion was 49%. In a report from one hospital, 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died by day 28 of ICU admission. [9,15]\nDiagnostic Testing\nInformation on specimen collection, handling, and storage is available at: Real-Time RT-PCR Panel for Detection 2019-Novel Coronavirus. After initial confirmation of COVID-10, additional testing of clinical specimens can help inform clinical management, including discharge planning.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities reported among hospitalized patients with pneumonia on admission included leukopenia (9\u201325%), leukocytosis (24\u201330%), lymphopenia (63%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (37%). [2,4] Among 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphocytopenia was present in 83%; 36% had thrombocytopenia, and 34% had leukopenia. [6] Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission. Chest CT images have shown bilateral involvement in most patients. Multiple areas of consolidation and ground glass opacities are typical findings reported to date. [2\u20134, 16\u201324] However, one study that evaluated the time from symptom onset to initial CT scan found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days had a normal CT. [20]\nLimited data are available about the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the virus has been isolated in cell culture from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In one case series\xa0 SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels in the first 3 days after symptom onset were higher in specimens collected from the nose than from the throat (as demonstrated by lower cycle threshold values in the nose). [25] A similar time course and pattern of viral RNA detection was reported in one asymptomatic patient after exposure to a patient with confirmed COVID-19. [25]\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. [26\u201329]. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known. It is possible that RNA could be detected for weeks, which has occurred in some cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. [30\u201337] Viable SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens. In contrast, viable MERS-CoV has been isolated only from respiratory tract specimens. [37\u201339]\nClinical Management and Treatment\nFor information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation may not initially require hospitalization. However, clinical signs and symptoms may worsen with progression to lower respiratory tract disease in the second week of illness; all patients should be monitored closely. Possible risk factors for progressing to severe illness may include, but are not limited to, older age, and underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and pregnancy.\nThe decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient\u2019s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient\u2019s home environment. For more information, see Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nNo specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.\nCorticosteroids should be avoided, because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients, unless indicated for other reasons.

In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and collaborators are working on development of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of compounds against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time.\nRemdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug that was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. [43]\xa0 Some patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. In China, multiple clinical trials of investigational therapeutics have been implemented, including two clinical trials of remdesivir. An NIH adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial external icon of investigational therapeutics for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States was approved by the Food and Drug Administration; the first investigational therapeutic to be studied is remdesivir. Other remdesivir trials for COVID-19 patients in the U.S. are available (participants with severeexternal icon and moderateexternal icon coronavirus disease). Some COVID-19 patients have received uncontrolled treatment with other investigational antivirals. [4, 28, 44] For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon, and www.chictr.org.cnexternal icon\nIn the absence of an approved vaccine, community mitigation measures are the primary way to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons in the community, and adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread in healthcare facilities. In the absence of an approved therapeutic with demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19 patients includes avoidance of corticosteroids, and supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support.\nDiscontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation\nFor recommendations on discontinuation of transmission-based precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see: Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 and  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19\nAdditional resources:\nEvaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nResources for Hospitals and Healthcare Professionals Preparing for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19\nInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings\nWorld Health Organization.
